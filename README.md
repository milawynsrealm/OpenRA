## Why OpenRA?
I am mostly interested in learning how to program larger projects, and by analyzing the source code of existing programs, I can learn a lot. Right now, I don't have any serious asperations with this project, but at the very least, I plan to make the games Red Alert 1 and Tiberium Sun run on modern systems. Maybe at some point, I'll create an original game (with 100% original content that is set in another universe entirely), but that's far into the future.

## Building OpenRA
Right now, the source code is set to be build under [Code::Blocks](https://www.codeblocks.org/) with [Mingw-w64](https://www.mingw-w64.org/) as a compiler.
